  <h1>About Me: Chloe Cook</h1>
  <p>My Favorite activites outside of class are hiking, being outside in general, and playing games! My favorite hike I've been on recently is <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/lakes-trail--3">Lakes Trail</a> in <a href="https://www.visitsequoia.com/">Sequoia National Park</a> </p>
